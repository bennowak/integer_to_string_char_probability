# Challenge
Using a web stack of your choice create a small web application to answer the following question:

If all the integers between 1 and 123 are spelled out in English with no spaces or conjunctions and compiled into a single string, answer these questions once:
    1) what is the total length of the string
    2) if a letter was selected at random from the string, what is the empirical probability it will be letter 'e'. ?

e.g the number 101 would be: "onehundredone"
    
Build this into a web application that has at least have an input box to receive a letter, and some output view to show the probability of that letter (as opposed to 'e' above).
